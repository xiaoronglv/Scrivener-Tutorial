\f0\fs26 \cf0 This has been a fairly thorough tour of all of the main features of Scrivener (or not so thorough if you only went through the \'93Quick Start\'94 documents, but enough to get you up and running, I hope). You probably won\'92t use half of the features you\'92ve just learned about for some time - in fact, on a daily basis, you will probably only use the most basic features of writing in the editor, creating new documents, and moving documents around in the binder. Everything in Scrivener gets out of your way until you need it - but at least you know what\'92s available and have a good idea of what you can do.\
\
There\'92s plenty of other stuff in there, too. For instance, I neglected to mention the project targets and statistics features in the Project menu, which you may well use frequently if you need to write to a particular length. They are fairly self-explanatory, though, so just try them out.\
\
What else? Well, once again, remember that Scrivener expects you to put everything that you want to export as part of your manuscript (okay, typescript for the pedants) inside the Draft folder. And remember that Scrivener is really about \'93hammering out\'94 that draft; it is not a word processor or full page layout program, so at some point\'97unless you just want a very basic manuscript\'97you may well want to move your work into a word processor for final formatting.\
\
Experiment! You should be able to work out the rest by playing with the program. If you get stuck, be sure to check out the comprehensive Scrivener Help from the Help menu. If you still have a problem, check out the FAQ on our wiki, or take a look at some of our tutorial videos on the web page:\
